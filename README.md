# FoundryVTTScriptMacros
A collection of script macros for Foundry VTT, functional with Version 12 and free for anyone to use. These are generally system agnostic, but have been made with Dungeons & Dragons 5e, Pathfinder 2e, and Starfinder in mind.

To use, create a macro in FoundryVTT and ensure it is set to Script and NOT Chat.
